# HexadecimalCHECKERs
For my **programming** work.


Pick an version you wish to use:

HexadecimalCHECKER-C [v1.0]
Language: ENG

Note:
To use it **effectively** you need to overwrite variables in *.c file.

HexadecimalCHECKER-C [v2.1]
Languages: ENG, PL

Note:
To use it **effectively** run *.exe file and simply tell the program numbers you wish to add/divide etc.. using the method shown on the screen.



Description of the program:
See the result of addition,multiplication, subtraction, division, modulus on hexadecimal variables.
Much faster than looking after calculator like this on the web or chaging your Windows calculator to programmer one.


Run and open in program for ex. Code Blocks.
